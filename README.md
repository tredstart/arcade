# Project Arcade

A simplistic tool to manage retrospectives.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in providing a retro for your team, you can do it in no time. Just register or log in (no emails or confirmations required).

After this, you will be able to create a new template for your next retro.

Then, by clicking on the link with the template you've created, a retro is initiated.

Congrats! Now you just share the link, and anybody can leave a comment under a category, providing their name/nickname, of course. As simple as that.
